This is a python script and some demo HTML that pulls from kusaba threads and makes a JSON out of all the posts with images.
This is designed to convert "quests" into a more traditional webcomic format, at least that's the goal.
The demo HTML (viewer.html) expects there to be numbered JSON files, such as 01.json, 02.json, etc.

This will hopefully be improved more over time.
